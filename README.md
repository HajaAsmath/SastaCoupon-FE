# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/)
- [Cyclic](https://app.cyclic.sh/#/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Memcache](https://memcached.org/)
